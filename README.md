# IMPROCESS
Improcess is a simple and clean documenting application to track down the improvement of your skills. Improcess will help you identify bottlenecks in your workflow as well as help you analyze your working performance. It combines Personal Software Process 2.1(Similar to CMMI5) and HCI principle to empower improvement of your skills. Our goal is to reimplement PSP in this application to make it fit with any kind of skills.
    
## What is PSP
The Personal Software Process (PSP) is a structured software development process that is intended (planned) to help software engineers better understand and improve their performance by bringing discipline to the way they develop software and tracking their predicted and actual development of the code. It clearly shows developers how to manage the quality of their products, how to make a sound plan, and how to make commitments. It also offers them the data to justify their plans. They can evaluate their work and suggest improvement direction by analyzing and reviewing development time, defects, and size data. The PSP was created by Watts Humphrey to apply the underlying principles of the Software Engineering Institute's (SEI) Capability Maturity Model (CMM) to the software development practices of a single developer. It claims to give software engineers the process skills necessary to work on a team software process (TSP) team.
